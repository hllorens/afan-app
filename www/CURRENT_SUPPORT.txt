We should probably load the sounds dinamically from different locations depending on the browsers.


IE9 (We don't consider older IEs): 
	Works with mp3 or m4a (audio/mpeg). Does not work with http cognitionis.com but works with dropbox URL (probably also with local)
Firefox: 
	Audio is sometimes not very smooth but it works
	Audio files must be in ogg format

Chrome: Works
Android chrome 36.0: Audio is sometimes not very smooth but it works

IOS Safari: 
	con sprite y WAV parece que no va, play-animal-sounds va... sera q no va currentPosition=...?
	Does not handle currentTime.. audio needs to be loaded differently
	See some audio spriting working example

Android Webkit: Sound load is not clear (first plays all sounds), audio is sometimes not very smooth but it works

Android App (Webkit):
	Sound load is not clear (first plays all sounds), as in firefox sound_play is not very smooth, en k a k a it works smoothly...why? working bad is sasa the rest works fine)
	Does not seem to support files loaded from local relative folder ./audio/
		
IOS App: ...


Try adding more silence padding in the sprite 0.5 sec, a bit better with 1 sec
See if it works better with (m4a and ogg) --- similar but resources are less heavi
TRY: adding setTimeout before you call play chain again 0.5 secs...

Add error handling (show to user) when audio is not supported
Probably, not worth it,...Try adding audio_sprite_object.currentTime = 0 everytime we call sprite_chain (kind of reset)  (to avoid having "s" "a" in a chain position which seems to be the conflictive one)
